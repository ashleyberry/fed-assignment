# Front End Development Assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About The Project

A single page web app replicating visual components from a Figma wireframe to help evaluate how I organize CSS, my overall approach to the assignment and how well I implement the chosen technologies. 

### The 'Why' behind the choice to use Styled Components
Topics some folks tend to avoid during family get-togethers: politics, religion, and CSS styling.

Styling of CSS styling is heavily debated. Even if Styled Components isn't your personal favorite approach to CSS, I ask that you keep an open mind (and maybe grab another serving of mashed potatoes).
I chose to use Styled Components for this single-page app because of the following:
:white_check_mark: it's a flexible approach to CSS styling.
:white_check_mark: it allows me to add, change and delete CSS without any unexpected consequences.
:white_check_mark: it allows for styles to be clearly defined and easy to understand.
:white_check_mark: they're easily reusable across the entire project.
:white_check_mark: it avoids CSS files, which can quickly get hefty and complex.
:white_check_mark: did you know you can [unit test Styled Components?!](https://github.com/styled-components/jest-styled-components)

All of these reasons mean I can get more done in a shorter amount of time, hence why I chose to implement Styled Components.
